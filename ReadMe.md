# Go-Ease

**GoEase** is a desktop application built using **Python** and **Tkinter** that allows users to extract slide-like frames from YouTube videos. It enables key frame detection based on a configurable frame interval and similarity threshold, then compiles the extracted frames into a downloadable PDF.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Extract Slides from YouTube**: Provide a video URL and extract visually distinct frames.
- **Customizable Settings**: Choose frame interval (in seconds) and frame similarity threshold.
- **PDF Generation**: Automatically compile extracted slides into a clean PDF.
- **Real-Time Progress Bar**: Stay updated with a progress bar while the video is being processed.

## 🧩 Requirements

Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed. Then, install the necessary dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Dependencies include:**

- `tkinter` – GUI library (usually comes with Python)
- `pillow` – Image handling
- `reportlab` – PDF generation
- `opencv-python` – Frame processing
- `numpy` – Image comparison
- `pytube` – YouTube video downloading

Make sure `tkinter` is installed (it is included with most Python distributions, but on Linux you may need to install it separately using your package manager).

## 🧪 How to Use

1. **Launch the App**: Run `main.py` to open the graphical interface.
2. **Paste YouTube URL**: Enter the URL of the video you want to extract slides from.
3. **Set Frame Interval**: Choose how frequently (in seconds) to extract frames.
4. **Adjust Similarity Threshold**: Define how similar consecutive frames need to be (0.0 to 1.0).
5. **Click "Extract Slides"**: The application will download the video and extract the slides.
6. **Click "Generate PDF"**: Once extraction is complete, generate a PDF from the slides and save it.

## 📂 Output

- Extracted slides are saved in a local `slides/` folder.
- PDF output is saved to a location of your choice.

---

## 📝 Notes

- A stable internet connection is required for downloading videos.
- The application uses a custom `SlideExtractor` class defined in `slide_extractor.py`.
- Make sure you have write permissions in the directory to save PDFs.
